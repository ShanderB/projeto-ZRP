# Which dependencies
Service - Maven 3.9.6, JDK 17, SpringBoot
Webapp - React 18, Axios 1.6

# How to run the project:

First, you need to install `JDK 17`, `Maven` (i'm using 3.9.6) and `npm` before anything.

For Windows, i created a `.bat` for execution.
If it's your first time running the project, run `build_local.bat`, if you've already built everything, just run `start_local.bat`.
